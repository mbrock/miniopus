=miniopus= is an efficient audio capture and streaming solution composed
of two main components: =minirec= and =miniogg=.

=minirec= operates as an audio capture server.

It captures audio input from a specified device. 

Then, it streams the audio to connected clients over UNIX sockets.

It uses the =miniaudio= library to capture the audio. 

It streams the captured audio data to all connected clients in real time.

=miniogg= functions as a client. 

It captures audio from a UNIX socket. 

The audio is encoded using the Opus codec. 

Then, the encoded audio is streamed to standard output.
